// We are now programming in an object oriented way.We are using objects to group state(information) and 
//logic(behaviour(codes written in methods)) in order to keep the code more organized.Now everything associated 
//to a task has been encapsulated inside the task object.

//OO bundles together state and logic into an object that can be represented as a single variable.
